- The given LearnJava.class and encrypted class files are unzipped and decompiled.  
- I used JD-gui to decompile it. From the source code, you can understand that it takes input using scanner and extracts a substring from flag{.
- This manipulated str is passed to checkPassword and it converts it into bytes and compares it with a predefined set of bytes which and returns true if the input is equal to what is in the arrayofbyte2
- converting the bytes using an ascii to string converted return the string KnoW_YouR_A5C115}, 
- i compiled and ran the source code and gave the entire string with "flag{" as input which gives the output access granted.

- the encrypted class source code takes 2 inputs and if user inputs match "G[Z@Z@G[VU_RT" and "flag" respectively, the flag is print by concatentating the various strings
